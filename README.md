**Iris Dataset Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Iris dataset using Python, pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization. The project demonstrates fundamental data analysis techniques including data loading, exploration, cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Usage


The analysis uses the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

**Each sample has four features measured in centimeters:**

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

# Analysis Process
The analysis follows these main steps:

**Data Loading and Exploration**

Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn
Create a pandas DataFrame
Explore the structure of the data
Check for missing values
Clean the dataset (fill missing values)


**Basic Statistical Analysis**

Compute basic statistics (mean, median, std)
Group data by species and analyze differences
Generate correlation matrix


**Data Visualization**

Create multiple types of plots to visualize the data
Customize plots with titles, labels, and legends
Save plots to the plots directory



**Visualizations**

The project includes several types of visualizations:

Line Chart: Shows simulated growth trends of different iris species over time
Bar Chart: Compares average measurements across species
Histogram: Illustrates the distribution of sepal length by species
Scatter Plot: Reveals the relationship between sepal length and petal length
Pair Plot: Provides a comprehensive view of all variables and their relationships

**Key Findings**

Analysis of the Iris dataset revealed several interesting patterns:

The three iris species are clearly distinguishable based on their measurements
Virginica generally has the largest measurements, followed by Versicolor, and then Setosa
Setosa has notably wider sepals but shorter petals compared to other species
Strong positive correlation exists between petal length and petal width (r ≈ 0.96)
Sepal length and petal length are also strongly correlated (r ≈ 0.87)
Sepal width has a negative correlation with other features
The scatter plot reveals three distinct clusters corresponding to the three species
Petal measurements are particularly effective for distinguishing between species
